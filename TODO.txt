BACKLOG - for NEXT RELEASES
FOR RC STATUS:
* implement as name lookup
* test binary ipasn db load and usage
* understand difference with cymru whois lookup
    * the difference is not solved by MRTX fixes.
    * test with RIPE RIS (http://www.ripe.net/data-tools/stats/ris/ris-raw-data) -- different views most likely cause
    * understand nature of multiple entries in MRT-records. we use only first.
      (actually all have same origin in TD1 test, so this shouldn't be it either)
* test for windows
* ipv6 support:
		(a) test radix - manually add/delete?
		(b) mrtx code would need it to be added - marked in code
* combine pyasn-util-* scripts into one script with good argument parsing
* perhaps, profiling pyasn.mrtx code

OTHER:
* upload our own asndb files (after recreation) to 3TU Datacenter

* installer: cleanup not working? what is our "coverage" ?
