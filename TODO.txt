BACKLOG - for NEXT RELEASES
FOR RC STATUS:
* implement as name lookup
* test binary ipasn db load and usage
* understand difference with cymru whois lookup
    * the difference is not solved by MRTX fixes.
    * test with RIPE RIS (http://www.ripe.net/data-tools/stats/ris/ris-raw-data) -- different views most likely cause
    * understand nature of multiple entries in MRT-records. we use only first.
      (actually all have same origin in TD1 test, so this shouldn't be it either)
    * in some instances, the difference was due to BOGON ASes. but none of these are actually in the test cases
    * CHECK ISSUE #16 for some ideas

* test for windows (done - tested with vs2010 + python3.4 / miniconda3, via pip and direct)
* ipv6 support: (done - tested with updates in mrtx, radix, lookups, tests)
		- tests on Windows left
* combine pyasn-util-* scripts into one script with good argument parsing
* perhaps, profiling pyasn.mrtx code
* perhaps, speed issues with .get_as_prefixes_effective()

OTHER:
* upload our own asndb files to 3TU Datacenter (DONE -- but not needs update)
    - this can be done after recreation of current IPASNDAT files (bogus & set routes changed - about 200/file)
    - and perhaps also binary format check.

* installer: cleanup not working? what is our "coverage" ?
