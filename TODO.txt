TODO LIST FOR PYASN-2, 22-may-2014



    !!! decide on where to put helper methods/scripts >> partially module (pyasn-mrtx.py), partially put in SCRIPTS
        > NOT COPIED NOW. ONLY COPIES THIS FOR NOW:
                    /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pyasn-1.5-py2.7-linux-x86_64.egg



    - test basic things work
        -builds on platforms
                        YES: builds on lin/py2 + win/py3.
        -basic methods work correctly :-)
        - [to test: binary format load given changes]
        - [to test: helper scripts, given changes)

    - unit tests?
        http://pythontesting.net/
        http://pytest.org/latest/goodpractises.html

    - test as-names file/load (and where to get sources from?!) (what format is fastest?)
    - IPv6 -- later -- main issue is the MRT formats reader
    - packaging
        - helper scripts ought to install
        - docstrings and everything else is neat, unit tests run
        - then upload
        - decide if license MIT is good (was BSD? is that compatible now?)... and add necessary updates [see below]


    


    
- finalize package structure
        >> update LICENSES (incl at start of source files)
                        add my own, (who is Michael J. Schultz? Damien Miller? Todd.Miller@courtesan.com?)
        >> other todo items in setup.py 
        >> FINALIZE README -- including markup perhaps (see pyradix on pypi)?
        >> sample IPASNDB - where to put?        

- upload to GITHUB >> on google code page, redirect here




** MORE **
       
PACKAGING     
 - test build on various envs: 
        >> windows w/ 2.7, 3.4...   + VS 2010 (or free version of it)
        >> windows w/ above + cygwin/miniconda
        >> ubuntu 2.7, ubuntu 3.4
        >> redhat 2.6, 3.3
        
- upload package to pypi (change gcode to link to it)
    https://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/setuptools.html      
    
- upload more IPASNDAT examples              to GITHUB
 

TESTING 
    - complete simple tests 
    - test all the space w/ previous pyasn / online sites like teamcymru/shadowserver
	e.g.: https://stat.ripe.net/data/prefix-overview/data.json?max_related=50&resource=131.180.77.102


CODE
	- fix the DOCS, and the easy TODOs in the code, and namings of things in the different files!
    - complete the as-names functionality & test it (icnl where to get the data, fastest way to retreive it, etc)
    -ipv6 (probably to be added to mrt converter, and tested w/ rest)
    - Performance >> memory usage still a bit high?
        
        
FUTURE WORK
    >> webservice version (e.g. flask) => might be interesting if very simple; might be redoing RIPESTATS!
    >> wiered extensions: call the RIPEstat JSON
    >> class pyasn_cacher: can be here, with logic to nnot reload the file if already in memory unless we run out of memory :)
	if we want/arman wants!
    >> could add RIPE DATA-API WRAPPER objects !
	>> r&d: have a look into maxmind's libarary source and if they have radix, etc
